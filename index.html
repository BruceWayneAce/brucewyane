<p>  <b>English defensive midfielder </b>  urged to sign for Chelsea ahead of Liverpool.
  <i>  Declan Rice</i> urged to join Chelsea ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool
    As per football.london, Arsenal prioritize a move for West Ham United captain Declan Rice amid his links with Chelsea and Liverpool. The Reds are currently in a transitional phase, having experienced some ups and downs in the past season.
    
    One area that the Reds could look to strengthen is their midfield, particularly after Fabinhoâ€™s recent form has been less than impressive. With this in mind, the club may be looking at potential transfer targets, including Rice.
    
    
    Moreover, adding certainty to the speculation of Rice moving, the Englishman himself admitted that he would want to move to a club playing Champions League football sooner than later. With his contract expiring in the summer of 2024 (Transfermarkt), this summer would stand crucial in helping David Moyes cash in big money for the player.
